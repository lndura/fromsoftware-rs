## Project structure (crates)

- `crates/eldenring` Contains the definitions for the Elden Ring structures. [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/eldenring.svg?label=eldenring)](https://crates.io/crates/eldenring) [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/eldenring/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/eldenring)
- `crates/eldenring-util` Provides helper methods for loading and working with Elden Ring structures.

- `crates/nightreign` Contains the definitions for the Elden Ring: Nightreign structures. [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/nightreign.svg?label=nightreign)](https://crates.io/crates/nightreign) [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/nightreign/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/nightreign)
- `crates/shared` Defines structures and utilities that are shared across multiple From Software games.

- `crates/shared/macros` Defines a derive macro for implementing the `FromSingleton` trait on types. **Do not depend on this directly since the macro is reexported through `fromsoftware-shared`**.

## Credits (aside listed contributors to this repository)

- Tremwil (for the arxan code restoration disabler, vtable-rs and a few other boilerplate-y things as well as implementing the initial FD4 singleton finder for TGA that I appropriated).
- Dasaav (for [libER](https://github.com/Dasaav-dsv/libER) and heaps of engine-related structures).
- Sfix (for coming up with the FD4 singleton finder approach at all).
- Yui (for the arxan code restoration disabler as well as some structures and AOBs).
- Vawser (and probably many more) (for hosting the param defs used with the param struct generator).
